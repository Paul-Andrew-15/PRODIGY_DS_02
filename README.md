## Sentiment Analysis of Twitter Data

### Objective:
To perform a comprehensive sentiment analysis of Twitter data, including preprocessing, visualization, and classification to understand sentiment patterns and improve predictive accuracy.

### Project Description:

1. Data Loading & Cleaning: Imported and combined Twitter sentiment data, handled missing values, and removed duplicates to ensure dataset quality.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed sentiment distribution and visualized data using pie charts and bar plots to understand class imbalances.
3. Text Preprocessing: Applied text normalization techniques including lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopwords removal, and stemming to prepare data for modeling.
4. Word Cloud Visualization: Created word clouds for different sentiment categories to visualize the most frequent terms and their emotional context.
5. Model Building & Evaluation: Developed and evaluated multiple classification models (Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression) using metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrices to determine the best-performing model.
